- 👋 Hi, I’m @Redbyte1
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about software and electronics though I'm fairly hopeless
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Lua, JavaScript/TypeScript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something? Anything really I guess.. I don't have a lot of experience and jumping into a deeply complex project is a difficult task
- 📫 You can reach me on Twitter I guess, I don't really use it but I'll probably notice eventually.. (
